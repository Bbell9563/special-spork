- Click the Fork button on the upper right-hand corner. This will save the repo to your GitHub account

- You now have a copy of the repo you just forked, available in your GitHub account

- Clone the repo locally by running `git clone git@github.com:<your github username>/guides-github-pull-request.git` in your terminal

- Open this repo in your terminal and run the following command to create a new branch: `git checkout -b add-your-name`

* Wait here for me to make a change 

- get my changes 'git pull origin master'

- THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY
